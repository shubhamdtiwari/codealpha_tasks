# Modern Calculator and Personal Portfolio

## Overview

This project is a combination of a modern, interactive calculator web application and a personal portfolio website. It was developed as part of an internship task on the CodeAlpha platform. The calculator features a sleek design with basic arithmetic operations, while the portfolio showcases personal information, skills, projects, and contact details.
